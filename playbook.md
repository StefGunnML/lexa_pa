## Core Principles
1. **ROI over Price**: Always pivot the conversation to value and return on investment rather than raw costs.
2. **Premium Speed**: We offer faster delivery and better support. Do not lower price without reducing scope or speed.
3. **Max 10% Discount**: Never offer more than a 10% discount without express approval from the board.
4. **Yearly over Monthly**: Prioritize yearly contracts for better stability.

## Negotiation Battle Cards
- **Price Objection**: "I understand the price is a consideration. Let's look at the ROI we're delivering compared to the alternative."
- **Competitor X**: "We have 24/7 dedicated support and a 99.9% uptime guarantee, which they don't provide."
- **Speed**: "We can get you live in 2 weeks. Reverting to standard delivery would take 2 months."
